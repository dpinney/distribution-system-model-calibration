This file contains a sample script for running the Co-Association Matrix
Ensemble Phase Identfication algorithm which uses customer advanced metering 
infrastructure (AMI) data with an ensemble spectral clustering algorithm and 
co-association matrix to cluster customers by their service phase. 

This script also requires functions that are in CA_Ensemble_Funcs.py and
PhaseIdent_Utils.py

Input Data Formatting:
    voltageInput: numpy array of float - This matrix contains the voltage 
        measurements (in volts) for all customers under consideration.  The
        matrix should be in the form (measurements,customers) where each 
        column represents one customer AMI timeseries.  It is recommended that
        the timeseries interval be at least 15-minute sampling, although the
        algorithm will still function using 30-minute or 60-minute interval
        sampling
    custIDInput: list of str - This is a list of customer IDs as strings.  The
        length of this list should match the customer dimension of voltageInput
    phaseLabelsErrors: numpy array of int - This contains the phase labels for
        each customer in integer form (i.e. 1 - Phase A, 2 - Phase B,
        3 - Phase C).  Any integer notation may be used for this field; it is 
        only used to assigned the final phase predictions.  In practice, this
        field could even be omitted, the phase identification results from 
        CAEnsemble will still be grouped by phase, and the assignment of final
        phase labels could be left for a post-processing step by the utility.
        The dimensions of this matrix should be (1, customers).
        These are assumed to be the original, utility labels, which
        may contain some number of errors.  The sample data included with these
        scripts has ~9% of phase labels injected with errors.  This can be 
        seen by comparing this field with the entries in phaseLabelsTrue which
        contains the ground-truth phase labels
    phaseLabelsTrue: numpy array of int (1,customers) - This contains the 
        ground-truth phase labels for each customer, if available.  Note that,
        in practice this may not be available, but for testing purposes this 
        is provided along with functions to evaluate the phase identifcation
        accuracy against the ground-truth labels.
        
The indexing of each of the input data must match, i.e. voltageInput[:,1] must
    represent the same customer as custIDInput[1], phaseLabelErrors[0,1] and
    phaseLabelsTrue[0,1]
