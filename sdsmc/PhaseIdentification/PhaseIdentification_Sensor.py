# Input data

voltageInputCust: numpy array of float (measurements,customers) - the AMI
   voltage timeseries for each customer.  Each column is the timeseries for 
   a single customer.  The units should be in volts.  
   
voltageInputSens: numpy array of float (measurements, sensor datastreams) - the
   sensor voltage timeseries.  Each column should be a sensor datastream with
   measurements in volts.  The length of the measurements dimension should
   match in length and timestamp with the voltageInputCust field.  Each data
   stream will correspond to one measurement field and phase for a particular
   sensor.  Currently our work is using the average voltage field from the
   sensors.  For example, if there are 10 sensors in the system, and the 
   average voltage field is used, each sensor will have measurements from each
   of the three phases A,B,C.  Thus the length of the sensor datastreams 
   dimension will be 30.  Our work utilized IntelliRupters which take 
   measurements on either side of the device, thus it might be expedient to 
   downselect to one of the two datastreams, as the two datastreams will 
   either be repeated (closed devices) or measuring two different sections of 
   the grid (open devices).  

sensPhases: numpy array of int (1,sensor datastreams) - the phase labels of
    the sensors in integer form.  1 - Phase A, 2 - Phase B, 3 - Phase C.  The
    number of sensor datastreams should match the dimensions and indexing of 
    axis 1 in voltageInputSens
    
sensIDs: list of str - the IDs for the sensors in string form.  The length of 
    this list should match the length and indexing of the sensor datastreams
    dimension of voltageInputSens and sensPhases.  (The IDs will be repeated
    for the different phase datastreams of the same sensor)
    
phaseLabelsTrue: numpy array of int (1,customers) - the ground truth phase 
    labels of each customer in integer form.  1 - Phase A, 2 - Phase B, 
    3 - Phase C.  The length of the array should match in length and indexing 
    with the customer dimension of voltageInputCust

phaseLabelsErrors: numpy array of int (1,customers) - the original utility phase 
    labels of each customer in integer form.  1 - Phase A, 2 - Phase B, 
    3 - Phase C.  The length of the array should match in length and indexing 
    with the customer dimension of voltageInputCust.  These labels are assumed
    to have erros in the labeling.  In the sampel data 18 customers have 
    labels which are different from the labels in phaseLabelsTrue
    
custIDInput: list of str (customers) - the customer IDs in string form for
    each customer.  This list should correspond in length and indexing with
    the customer dimension in voltageInputCust and phaseLabelsInput
