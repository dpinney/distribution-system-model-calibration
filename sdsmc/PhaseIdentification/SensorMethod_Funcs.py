    """ This function takes customer voltage timeseries and voltage timeseries
        from other sensors and assigns a phase label to the customer based on 
        votes from the highest correlated sensors.  For more details, see
        the paper listed above.
            
            Parameters
            ---------
                voltageCust:  numpy array of float (measurements,customers) 
                    AMI voltage timeseries for each customer.  Each column
                    corresponds to a single customers timeseries.  This data
                    should be in per-unit, difference (delta) representation. 
                    That preprocessing is a critical step.
                voltageSens:  numpy array of float (measurements,sensors*phases*datastreams) 
                    voltage timeseries for the sensor datastream.  Each column
                    corresponds to a sensor datastream timeseries.  This data
                    should be in per-unit, difference (delta) representation.
                    The measurements dimension should match in length and 
                    measurement interval with voltageCust
                custIDInput: list of str - the list of customer IDs.  The 
                    length and indexing should match with the customer dimension
                    (axis 1) of voltageCust
                sensIDInput: list of str - the list of sensor IDs.  Each sensor will
                    likely have measurements for all three phases, so this list
                    will have repeating groups in that case.  The length and
                    indexing should match axis 1 of voltageSens
                phaseLabelsSens: numpy array of int (1,sensors*3) - the phase 
                    labels for each sensor.  This assumes that each sensor will 
                    have measurements for all three phases.
                windowSize: int - the number of samples to use in each window
                numVotes: int - the number of sensor to use in making the
                    phase prediction for each customer.  The default for this
                    parameter is 5.  Make sure this number is less than or 
                    equal to the total number of sensors available.  
                dropLowCCSepFlag: boolean - If true this flag calls the 
                    function to drop CC values where the CC Separation is below the
                    ccSepThresh value.  The default value is False, mean all
                    CC values are considered.
                ccSepThresh: float - if dropLowCCSepFlag is set to True, then
                    this parameter must also be passed.  CC values in each 
                    window, where the CC Separation is below this value are dropped.
                minWindowThreshold: int - the minimum number of windows that 
                    must be available for each customer.  If a customer has 
                    fewer windows then they are omitted from the analysis.  
            Returns
            -------
                newPhaseLabels: numpy array of int (1,customers) - the 
                    predicted phase labels for each customer
                ccMatrix: numpy array of float (customers,customers) - the final,
                    median, correlation coefficients for all customers over
                    all windows
                custIDFound: list of str - the customer IDs for customers
                    which were predicted, i.e. not eliminated due to missing
                    data.  This list will match the dimensions of all other
                    outputs of this function
                noVotesIndex: list of int - the indices of customers who were
                    removed from all windows
                noVotesIDs: list of str - the customer IDs of customers who 
                    were removed from all windows
                omittedCust: dict - two keys minWindows and missDataOrFiltered
                    minWindows is a list of customer IDs which were omitted 
                    from the analysis because they did not meet the minimum 
                    number of windows, and missDataOrFiltered is a list of 
                    customer IDs which were omitted due, either to missing data
                    or being filtered due to the CC Separation filter
                sensVotesConfScore: list of float - each entry is the percentage of sensors 
                    which agree on the phase prediction for that customer
                winVotesConfScore: list of float - each entry is the percentage of windows 
                    which have the same phase vote for each customer.  This is 
                    calculated by considering the phase of the sensor datastream with 
                    the highest CC in each window as a vote
                ccSeparation: list of float - each entry is the difference between the 
                    highest CC and the next highest CC, considering the mean CC across
                    windows.
                confScoreCombined: list of float - the combination of the sensVotes and
                    the ccSeparation.  Obtained by multiplying those scores together    
                custWindowCounts: numpy array of int (customers) - the count,
                    for each customer, of the number of windows that were
                    included in the analysis, i.e. the number of windows that 
                    were not excluded due to missing data.  This count is 
                    significantly affected by the value chosen for the 
                    windowSize parameter

            the percentage of sensors which agree on the predicted phase for
            the customers.  Only the sensors included in the votes are
            considered.  2.  winVotes is the percentage of windows which

            between the CC on the predicted phase versus the next highest CC.
            4. CombConfScore is the winVotes and the sensVotes multiplied

    Parameters
    ---------
        ccMatrixAllWindows: numpy array of float (num customers, number of sensors, number of windows) - 
            the correlation coefficient values between a particular customer and a set of
            sensors. The indexing of axis 0 must match the indexing for
            custIDList.  The indexing of axis 1 must match the indexing for 
            sensIDInput
        meanCCMatrix: numpy array of float (num customers, number of sensors) -
            The mean correlation coefficients over all windows.  If any 
            customers were eliminated due to missing data, then the whole
            column will be NaN
        custIDList: list of str - the list of customer IDs.  This list must
            match the indexing for ccMatrixInput axis 0
        sensIDInput: list of str - the list of sensors IDs.  This list must
            match the indexing for ccMatrixInput axis 1
        sensPhasesInput: numpy array of int (1, sensor datastreams) - the 
            phase labels for each sensor datastream
        noVotesIDs: list of str - the list of customers which were excluded
            from the phase prediction due to missing data
        numVotes: int - the number of sensor votes included in the phase 
            prediction
        allWindowVotes: numpy array of int (customers,windows) - the phase vote
            for each customer in each window.  Windows where the customer was 
            omitted contain -999
        allSensVotes: list of arrays of int - the sensor votes for each customer 
            The length of the main list is the number of customers.  Each list
            item is the sensor votes from the highest correlated sensors, up
            to numVotes sensors.  The length of these arrays may vary if some
            sensors were excluded from voting.  
            analysis
        newPhasLabels: numpy array of int (1,customers) - the predicted phase
            labels for each customer

    Returns
    -------
        sensVotesConfScore: list of float - each entry is the percentage of sensors 
            which agree on the phase prediction for that customer.  This may
            be 0 if sensPhasesInput had 3 entries, i.e. in the substation
            case
        winVotesConfScore: list of float - each entry is the percentage of windows 
            which have the same phase vote for each customer.  This is 
            calculated by considering the phase of the sensor datastream with 
            the highest CC in each window as a vote
        ccSeparation: list of float - each entry is the difference between the 
            highest CC and the next highest CC, considering the mean CC across
            windows.
        confScoreCombined: list of float - the combination of the sensVotes and
            the ccSeparation.  Obtained by multiplying those scores together.
            This may be 0 if sensPhaseInput had 3 entries, i.e. in the substation
            case.
        numWindows: list of int - the number of windows included in each
